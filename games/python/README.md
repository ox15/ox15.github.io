Anagrams doesn't currently work, so don't try to run it. You can run these files in your IDE (Spyder, Code, etc.) by opening the file and pressing F5. You can also run them these ways.

Linux/Mac

Start up bash or sh in your terminal (bash should launch a few seconds after you start it) and type "python " then the file name. These files have a shebang, so you can type the path to the file (use "./" for the current directory) then the file name. The shebang runs the files with python3, but you can try python2.

Windows

If you haven't installed Python yet, you can get it at [https://www.python.org/downloads/]
Start up your CMD, go to the directory where you saved the file, and type "python " followed by the file name.
