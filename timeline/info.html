    <div>You can move the timeline (drag mouse over timeline) and zoom in and out (mouse wheel up/down.
    Clicking on a item will display info in this box, if that item has any info to display. A few things to note:
    <ul>
        <li>If you can't move your mouse out of the timeline, just click inside it.</li>
        <li>Some links might not load on older computers because your computer thinks that site's certificate has expired. In Chrome, this shows a gray background with a sad face.</li>
    </ul>
