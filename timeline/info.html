    <div>You can move the timeline (drag mouse over timeline) and zoom in and out (mouse wheel up/down).
    Clicking on a item will display info in this box, if that item has any info to display. A few things to note:
    <ul>
        <li>Scrolling on the timeline will zoom in and out. If you want to scroll the page, move the mouse pointer off of the timeline</li>
        <li>If the timeline keeps moving even after you stop dragging, just click outside of it.</li>
        <li>Some pages might not load. You'll see "Firefox can't open this page" in Firefox, or a gray background with a <img src="sadface.png" alt="sad face" style="width:1em"> in Chrome and Edge. Here's why:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If it says "this site can't be reached", your old computer (OSX El Capitan or Windows XP, for example) thinks that site's certificate has expired</li>
            <li>If it says the site "refused to connect" or something about security, the site doesn't allow itself to be embedded. You can right-click on the link and "open in a new window". Please <a href="https://forms.gle/oU237B8RYKpx83Ff6" target="_blank">report these on the form</a> if they are <strong>not</strong> in the following list.</li>
            <ul>

                <li>rmg.co.uk</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>You can get back to this info by reloading the page</li>
